# MusicMix - Online android app

This was a school (SKP - skolepraktik) project.

This is an mobile application for one of my previous projects - <a href="https://github.com/DainisM/MusicMix-web-app">MusicMix - web app</a> that uses an API (written in Node.js with Express.js) and lets user access and listen to songs and users own playlists and information. The idea (again) was to make an Spotify like mobile app using React Native.</br>

User can find all sort of music by music genre or mood (chill, motivation, workout etc.), find all songs and some info for artist/band and of course make and listen to his own playlists which user can add or remove songs from.
